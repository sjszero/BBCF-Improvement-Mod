// What the training dummy has been told to do, and when.
//
// This replaces two systems that grew up separately and could not be combined:
//
//   - The old "dummy actions" panel, which could force one of the dummy's own script states
//     on four hard-coded triggers, and nothing else.
//   - Unlimited Playback, whose library could fire a recorded playback on any of seven
//     triggers - but only ONE trigger at a time, because picking a trigger type in its
//     settings cleared every other one ("Selects the single trigger type that can fire
//     library playback").
//
// The model here is a trigger-first table: every trigger independently holds at most one
// action, and an action names WHERE its inputs come from. So a wakeup DP, an on-hit burst
// and a looping blockstring can all be armed at once, which neither system allowed.
//
// A library is a named collection of recorded playbacks on disk - which is what an Unlimited
// Playback "profile" already is, since SaveProfile embeds every entry's playback bytes in the
// file. Each trigger names the library it draws from, so On Wakeup and On Block Gap can pull
// from entirely different sets, and the same library can serve several triggers.
//
// That makes PlaybackEntry::triggerEnabled obsolete: which entries a trigger may use is now
// decided by which library is assigned, not by a flag on every entry. Old library files still
// parse, and the field is read and discarded.
//
// See docs/DummyActionsRework.md for the whole design.
