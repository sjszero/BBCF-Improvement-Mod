/*
	One shared way to put a Windows file picker on screen.

	Doing this wrong is what makes the game hang or die, and the same block of OPENFILENAMEA
	setup had been copy-pasted into four windows, three of them getting it right and one not.
	The rules the copies had to remember, now in one place:

	  - Never call GetOpenFileName/GetSaveFileName on the render thread. The common dialog
	    pumps its own message loop; doing that from inside the present/ImGui path freezes the
	    game for as long as the dialog is up and can deadlock outright. The dialog runs on a
	    worker thread and the answer is picked up later, from the UI, via Consume().
	  - Always pass OFN_NOCHANGEDIR and restore the working directory afterwards. Without it
	    the picker silently changes the process CWD, and every relative path the mod uses
	    after that - settings, palettes, TAS movie files - resolves somewhere else.
	  - Never set hwndOwner to the game window. An owned modal ties the dialog's message loop
	    to a window the render thread is driving.
	  - Only one dialog at a time.

	Usage: call Open() with a token identifying the caller, then poll Consume() with the same
	token every frame until it returns true.
