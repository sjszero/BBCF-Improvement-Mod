	Everything you want while a replay is on screen: rewind it, take it over, or capture a
	stretch of it as a playback.

	All three used to be collapsing headers buried on the mod menu's Replays page, with the
	rewind bar additionally existing as its own title-bar-less window you toggled with a
	button called "Toggle Rewind". Nobody found any of it.

	The control sets live in the ReplayExtras namespace, which is the only place they are
	written, and two hosts draw them: the small ReplayExtrasWindow that sits on screen while
	you watch, and the mod menu's Replays page. Both are live at once, so each host passes an
	id scope - two modals with one ImGui id in the same frame is one modal with a fight over
	it.
