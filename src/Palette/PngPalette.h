// PNG palette interchange, matching the convention the UNI2 Improvement Mod uses so
// palettes travel between the two mods (and through unPAC's palette.png) unchanged:
// the colors live in the PNG's PLTE chunk, not in the pixel grid, and index 0 is the
// transparency slot and is left alone on import.
//
// BBCF palettes are BGRA (a little-endian uint32 reads 0xAARRGGBB) and the editor
// exposes alpha, so unlike UNI2 we do not throw alpha away: PLTE is RGB-only, so the
// alpha channel rides along in the standard tRNS chunk and is read back from it.

	// marked ancillary and safe-to-copy, so a well-behaved editor preserves it across a
	// palette edit - but plenty of editors rewrite a file from scratch and drop chunks
	// they do not know, so `hasExtras` is false often enough that callers must handle it.
