// Pictures to edit a palette's effect files on.
//
// A palette's files 1-7 colour the character's effects, and none of those appear on the
// reference sheet. Which effect sprite the game draws with which file is decided by the
// character's scripts (setPalette) and per-image overrides in the .jonbin data; that is
// worked out offline by tools/build_effect_palette_map.py and embedded as a small map.
// The sprites themselves come from the player's own game files: char_XX_img.pac and
// char_XX_vri.pac are streamed through the inflater and only the listed images are kept,
// so a 30 MB archive never sits in memory whole.
//
// Loading runs on a worker thread, one character at a time. Each effect file then gets
// its own sheet: every sprite drawn with that file, cropped, shrunk to a common size and
// laid out in rows, as palette indices - so the editor can map a click back to an entry
// exactly the way it does on the character's reference sheet.

	// (3040) never show their own entries - the game rebuilds their colours from two or

	// are faded per `fade`; nullptr fades nothing. Returns width*height 0xAARRGGBB pixels,
