"""Pack one idle sprite per character into the thumbnail blob the mod embeds.

These back the palette grid: every palette of a character shares the same sprite
and differs only in the 256 colours applied to it, so one set of indices per
character is all the grid ever needs.

The sprite is `<prefix>000_00.hip` from data/Char/char_<tag>_img.pac - animation
0, frame 0, which is the neutral standing pose for all 36 characters. It is
cropped to its bounding box and scaled down in INDEX space, which is why the
downscale takes the most common index in each source block rather than averaging:
averaging palette indices is meaningless, and the whole point is to keep the
image recolourable.

Requires a BBCF install to read the sprites from. Output is checked in, so this
only needs re-running if the thumbnail geometry changes.

Usage:
    python tools/build_palette_thumbnails.py "<BBCF install dir>" [-o resource/palette_thumbnails.bin]
